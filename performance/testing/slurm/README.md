# Performance Experiments

We want to prototype a setup that will deploy VMs (with SLURM) on several clouds, including:

 - [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/hpc-toolkit/docs/quickstarts/slurm-cluster) using hpc-toolkit
 - **AWS** using parallel cluster (TBA)
 
## Prototypes

 - [google-cloud-0](google-cloud-0): just getting familiar with the tools and how to automate things!
 - [aws-0](aws-0): testing deploying parallel cluster on AWS
 - [azure-0](azure-0): uses cycle cloud
