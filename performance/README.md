# Performance Experiments

We want to prototype a setup that will deploy VMs (with SLURM) on several clouds, including:

 - [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/hpc-toolkit/docs/quickstarts/slurm-cluster) using hpc-toolkit
 - **AWS** using parallel cluster (TBA)
 
## Prototypes

 - [prototypes/google-cloud-0](prototypes/google-cloud-0): just getting familiar with the tools and how to automate things!
