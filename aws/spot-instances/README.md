# Spot Instances

These are experiments with spot instances.

 - [run0](run0): Based on [these experiments](https://github.com/converged-computing/cloud-select/tree/main/examples/spot-instances/experiments/request-success) I want to very naively try running LAMMPS (with the metrics operator) on a Potpurri of nodes.
 - [run1](run1): A set of three experiments that test deploying spot instances using the Flux Operator.
 - [run2](run2): Using linear programming to work on an optimization approach (fun)!
