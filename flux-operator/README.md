# Flux Operator Example

This will be an example (experiment) to create Flux Operator assets (config maps, service, etc) that can be deployed alongside
the Metrics operator, meaning that:

 - The Flux Operator (Flux MiniCluster) is the application of interest
 - We can collect metrics alongside it.

My first idea is to save all the assets for a small LAMMPS run and then package the actual cluster into
the metrics operator setup, and then allow the application to take a custom network instead of the one
that we create.

 - Experiment setup and running is here
 - Example python parsing is under [perf](perf)

## Usage

Create a local kind cluster:

```bash
$ kind create cluster
```

### 1. Create Flux Operator Assets

Let's first create assets for the Flux Operator. We will install the Flux Operator to start with a LAMMPS [minicluster.yaml](minicluster.yaml).

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/releases/download/0.1.0/flux-operator.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f minicluster.yaml
```

Now let's save the yaml assets for inspection / later use

```bash
kubectl get jobs flux-sample -o yaml > yaml/minicluster-job.yaml
kubectl get svc flux-service -o yaml > yaml/minicluster-service.yaml
kubectl get cm flux-sample-curve-mount -o yaml > yaml/minicluster-curve-cm.yaml
kubectl get cm flux-sample-entrypoint -o yaml > yaml/minicluster-entrypoint-cm.yaml
kubectl get cm flux-sample-flux-config -o yaml > yaml/minicluster-config-cm.yaml
```

We can then assemble a custom yaml that includes everything except for the Job, which we will create
via the Metrics Operator. We shouldn't need the flux operator headless service, because the metrics operator will
create one for the application. However, we do want to give it a custom name. Note that I assembled this into
[yaml/minicluster.yaml](yaml/minicluster.yaml).  Note that the tweaks needed are:

- hostname in the broker config / entrypoint for R generation needs to be tweaked for a JobSet, e.g., 
  - `flux-sample-0.flux-service.default.svc.cluster.local` changed to `flux-sample-m-0-0.flux-service.default.svc.cluster.local`
- metrics.yaml size needs to correspond with MiniCluster size
- tasks/cores (and when added) resource limits too.

Let's next delete the flux operator to free up our tiny
resources.

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/releases/download/0.1.0/flux-operator.yaml
```

Now let's install JobSet and the metrics operator:

```bash
VERSION=v0.2.0
kubectl apply --server-side -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/releases/download/$VERSION/manifests.yaml
```

Install the operator (from the development manifest here):

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f ../../dist/metrics-operator-dev.yaml
```

How to see metrics operator logs:

```bash
$ kubectl logs -n metrics-system metrics-controller-manager-859c66464c-7rpbw
```

Then create the flux operator assets. This includes the entrypoint, the flux broker config,
and the curve certificate.

```bash
kubectl apply -f yaml/minicluster.yaml
```

That should only need to create three config maps:

```bash
 kubectl get cm
NAME                      DATA   AGE
flux-sample-curve-mount   1      14s
flux-sample-entrypoint    1      14s
flux-sample-flux-config   1      14s
kube-root-ca.crt          1      59m
```

Then create the metrics set. This is going to run a simple sysstat tool to collect metrics
as lammps runs (we hope)!

```bash
kubectl apply -f metrics.yaml
```

Wait until you see pods created by the job and then running (there should be four. Each pod has flux running LAMMPS,
and sidecar containers to watch that process:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```console
NAME                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
flux-sample-m-0-0-ggc64   0/2     Completed   0          2m24s
flux-sample-m-0-1-nhqd7   0/2     Completed   0          2m24s
flux-sample-m-0-2-ph99v   0/2     Completed   0          2m24s
flux-sample-m-0-3-qw77b   0/2     Completed   0          2m24s
```

You can look at an application "app" container in any pod to see flux (and LAMMPS)

```bash
kubectl flux-sample-m-0-0-ggc64 -c app -f
```

Also notice the log is formatted so we should be able to add a Python parser soon.

When you are done, the job and jobset will be completed.

```bash
$ kubectl get jobset
```
```console

And then you can cleanup!

```bash

We will add the Python parser for this metric soon.
