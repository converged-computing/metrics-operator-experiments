# FIO Storage Experiments

**Important** we only have 15 minutes to present, and decided the lammps performance story
was most interesting. We can do these storage experiments another time.

These are experiments to benchmark a single node. While we would like to benchmark more of
an HPC usecase with multiple, that requires networking that isn't there yet, and we do not
want to confound the two things.

 - [run0](run0): basic test for filestore, a csi driver, and fusion
 - [run1](run1): planning experimental setup
 - [run2](run2): trying to figure out additional single node setups
