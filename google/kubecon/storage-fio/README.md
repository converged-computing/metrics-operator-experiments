# FIO Storage Experiments

These are experiments to benchmark a single node. While we would like to benchmark more of
an HPC usecase with multiple, that requires networking that isn't there yet, and we do not
want to confound the two things.

 - [run0](run0): basic test for filestore, a csi driver, and fusion
 - [run1](run1): planning experimental setup
 - [run2](run2): trying to figure out additional single node setups
