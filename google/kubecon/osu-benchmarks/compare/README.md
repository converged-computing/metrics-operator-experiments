# Plot OSU Benchmarks

This will be a quick script to plot [HPC results](../../hpc/lassen-run1/) and compare
to the [Google Cloud](../run4) results.

```bash
python plot-osu-benchmarks.py
```

For the talk coming up, we will want to show
the GCP metrics first  (on the same axis) and then add onto it the HPC results
to show the stark contrast. It's not a big deal and not about one being better,
it's about understanding the current state to improve upon.
