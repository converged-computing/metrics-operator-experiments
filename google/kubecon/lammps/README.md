# Kubecon Experiments

 - [run0](run0) is the original experiment setup, and primarily testing for the main one.
 - [run1](run1) is the same experiment, run for real over 6 hours on 17 nodes.
 - [run2](run2) is a subset of that, but just the automated lammps to run at a larger scale.
 - [run3](run3) and [run3-test](run3-test) were for debugging running LAMMPS with and without HPCToolkit.
 - [run4](run4) is a re-attempt of the small scaling study, but with a larger problem size (and no HPCToolkit)
